## Agenda

## Announcements
 
*Extracted from **package-maintenance-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* No announcements  today

### nodejs/package-maintenance

* https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/225
  * Discussed and agreed to switch over to Tuesday at 9 AM EST and 3 PM EST.
    * Action: Michael to update the calendar with the new times -> done.
      * Next meeting is 9 AM EST on Tuesday Aug 13th.

* Support file [#220](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/pull/220)
  * support field to support "license" 
  * LJ, agreement should be .json, roughly agreed on content
  * last question is whether it should be in package.json or be a seperate file in
    package or a url 
  * Wes, still thinks that bigger problem author dropping off the map, expires?
  * Wes, ok with in-line now, one other suggestion would be whatever tooling, repo
    that has exceptions - “known corrections”
  * Ahmad, note on separation of files, use of package.json means that other ecosystems
    cannot have advantage of approach. 
  * Dominykas, any way to get npm provide additional file.  Ahmad committed to work with
    community to do the right thing
  * Wes that risks not getting a good solution in place today
  * Ahmad suggestion is reference in package.json in the file
  * LJ, npm feature request to update readme without release. npm read the data command but
    needs update without publish for readme
  * Manual, when user need support file?  Would check when choosing which modules/libraries
    may want to open issue when checking, URL or something that is online might fit better than
    publish, but would be ok with inline.
  * Move forward for now.

[#218](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/218)
* pending comment by LJ - is there a better format for humans and computers? Manuel and LJ
  will continue convo in GH.

* Reach out to Travis to get option that includes
[#205](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/205)
   * Dominykas - reached out to Travis to find out if they can change to latest version. Talked
     about the grammar from Renovate, maybe take and reuse for support field. Will open a
     separate issue for this. 90% of repos use travis? Most important CI tool
  * LJ - wants to create feature for LTS - 1 or LTS - 2 in yaml file, maybe good for Travis to hold
    off on updates for this release?

* Next steps on Support levels in Package.json 
[#192](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/192)
  * Blocked by [#220](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/220) - probably will
    be unblocked in the next few days the implementation of the tooling

* \[baseline practices\] .npmignore or package.json files [#164](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/164)
* LJ - talked about two different concerns / approaches, outlined in GH
  * if you are concerned about size of tarball - want to restrict the number of files 
    added
  * people need to access everything offline - no npm ignore…
  * Wes - do we want to give official guidance?
  * LJ - maybe we give people pros and cons of choices
  * Ahmad - best practice-s (plural) - offer different perspectives of different solutions
  * Wes - maybe a blog post and updates to NPM docs? Is that our goal?
  * Dominykas - NPM docs open to PRs
  * Ahmad - maybe blog post asks the question
  * Wes - use cases and examples for different paths

* Which Problems Node.js OSS maintainers/authors face today? [#113](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/113)
 * Wes - express and mqtt participated, results - mostly maintainers need triage help. Maybe the
    two groups need to get on a call together and discuss what they need. 
    * Three tiers of issues - maintain tags on repos to direct users where to go: triage (newest),
      question, discuss, unlabeled list, 
    * top 10 (ish) issues agreed upon - for people who have more context on the project,
    * top-level objectives - bigger projects and initiatives - for people who really have context on
      the project

* Manuel - tools for helping maintainers - ex. word cloud for issues to see where problems lie
* Wes - may do the same for express, did create a tool pkgas. We are split across GH orgs,
  want to create a tool to consolidate. Babel and some are consolidated or are a monorepo, but
  express has the problem of being a little more scattered across orgs
    * Dominykas - tool to publish with 2fa…
      * Wes - this would be helpful to our Express team rn
* Discuss release automation for Express: https://github.com/expressjs/discussions/issues/85

## Project Board Review (maybe, if time permits).

* Ask participants about the state of [Project Board](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/projects/1) and necessary changes if time permits.
