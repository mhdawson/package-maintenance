### nodejs/package-maintenance

* Engaging Enterprise teams to better understand challenges at scale [#138](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/138)
  * Tierney, Ahmad was working on tool over the weekend.
  * Michael , this should our 4th area of focus as we jump in.
  * Lance -> Red Hat this is important to us as well so will get involved in this effort
  * Michael since those who opened issue/are interested in participating are
    not in today’s meeting let’s skip for this time and collaborate through github
    and leave on agenda for next time. 

* Discussion: Baseline practices - brainstorm initial list [#119](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/119)
  * Next step is a summary/structure of the practices we want to put
    in place to be captured.
  * Michael gave overview of baseline practice for capturing support
    Information in package.json.  
    * From discussion sounds like the naming is a bit confusing
    * Matteo expressed that it would be better if it was a strict ordered list, 
      Michael is not sure if that will work as it may be more like licences
      where there are “different” but not necessarily better or worse
      levels.
    * We need to continue to refine through comments/updates to the
      PR.

* Which Problems Node.js OSS maintainers/authors face today? [#113](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/113)
  * Matteo took action to generate a summary from the discussion
    so far and to create a list of package maintainers (as discussed
    in last meeting we can start with list of “Friendly” maintainers
    that Wes is creating as part of 
    https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/105) 
    that we can reach out to get additional feedback.

* Process to identify and engage  with "Key Packages" [#105](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/105)
  * Next step is for Wes to create 3 issues for the steps he proposed
    that we follow.

* discourage use of unmaintained packages [#93](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/93)
* Brief discussion.  Joel is going to take action to PR in baseline practice for
  this and we can continue discussion in that PR.

* Suggestion: Provide template/guides/automation for common maintainer needs [#17](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/17)
  * Tierney, set up the things that we want, for example
    * testing on all Node.js LTS versions
    * testing on different platforms
  * Tierney - volunteered to provide some structure, PR in in that structure to
    the repo so we can ask people to help fill in it.

* Joel, infosec is becoming more of an issue.
  * npm install automatically runs scripts pre/post install which is triggering concern
  * is the security WG thinking about this?
  * Tierney went to npm suggestions and put in a suggestion around ignoring scripts
    * https://npm.community/t/add-ignore-script-scripts/4169
  * Michael, this is something the security WG is looking at right how.  
  * Matteo, don’t run npm install on production machines. Security WG might provide
    guidance not to do that.
  * Joel, agree but unfortunately some teams do their own thing.
  * Lance may also be some complications in the container.
  * Joel will open issue in Security WG repo to ask if group can develop some guidance
    around production deployment.
