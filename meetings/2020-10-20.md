## Agenda

## Announcements
 
*Extracted from **package-maintenance-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/package-maintenance


* Suggested list of modules to help get support info into [#413](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/413)
  * discussed, we all just need to work on this as we have time.


* Publishing Strategy for PkgJS packages [#410](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/410)
  * There are pros and cons
    * We agreed that dual publishing does not make sense
    * part of the concern over scopes was usage with npx
      * potential name collision, Wes fixed in 7?
    * Jordan may still be a while before people upgrade to 7?
   * Dominykas, where should issue related to npx be raised? 
    * Darcy against cli repo
  * So agreement:
    * publish if scope if you want, but ok without scope as well
    * Need to document step when publishing in non-scope to transfer to 
      pkgjs org.


* Building `create-pkg` [#404](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/404)
  * Darcy filled in the background
    * Still need to find time to push forward
    * Wes needs to push the code he has 


* Suggest ignoring a vulnerability by the package maintainer [#386](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/386)
  * There have been discussions over a number of years 
  * Collaboration space, place for cross cutting discussions important
    Node.js and JavaScript.
  * Going to get people together to discuss/document:
    * reduce the frustration of maintainers in audit results that don’t apply
    * documented proposal with support by npm, Synk etc to improve 
  * Darcy has talked to people with in Github and interest in moving forward as
    well.
    
* PkgJS Org for WG supported tooling [#271](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/271)
  * all complete, closed.


* Next steps on Support levels in Package.json [#192](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/192)
  * working on this as next step -> 
    [#413](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/413)




* [418](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/418)
  * README.md indicates that it needs maintainers
  * Glenn, will contact the maintainer to ask questions we discussed
  * Discussion around writing standard practice for how to handle these
    kinds of situations. 
    * use this case as real world case to help write up 


## Project Board Review (maybe, if time permits).
