## Agenda

## Announcements
 
*Extracted from **package-maintenance-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.
 * No announcements this week

* Support file [#220](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/pull/220)
  * Continued discussion in the issue tracker.  Nothing specfic to discuss in the meeting
    today.

  * Related/covered under #220

* Reach out to Travis to get option that includes LTS releases + current [#205](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/205)
  * Dominykas tried to contact them.  Now an issue in their tracker.
  * Would still be good if somebody with a closer relationship could talk to a
    contact there to see if they think it’s a good/bad idea.

* \[baseline practices\] .npmignore or package.json files [#164](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/164)
  * From discussion in the meeting this week, sound like the next steps might be a PR
    for the guidance and then a blog post to publicize but the guidance
    might be more around discussing the options versus making a specific
    recommendation.

* Which Problems Node.js OSS maintainers/authors face today? [#113](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/113)
  * Ahmad is offering to get data if we can come up with specifics for what we’d want to look for

* Standard grammar/keywords to reference node release lines https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/236
  * Bethany will show to the release team
  * note in the browser world “browserslist” is the defacto-standard for a standard language for “targeting” environment. (this is applicable to both #236 & #220)
  * For reference, link to the full list of queries for browserlist:
    https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#full-list

* OpenJS Foundation project progression https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/238
  * As an FYI that we should thinking about if we should be including references to the OpenJS 
    Foundation as a path for modules.
  * Also to consider at some point if this team should be part of Node.js project or
    OpenJS foundation.

## Project Board Review (maybe, if time permits).

Ask participants about the state of [Project Board](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/projects/1) and necessary changes if time permits.
